# About Me

I am a resourceful and dedicated Legal Intern currently pursuing my **3rd year at SASTRA Deemed University, Thanjavur**.  

I have developed strong analytical, research, and drafting skills through internships, legal writing, and participation in moot courts and debates. My goal is to leverage adaptability and meticulous attention to detail in building a professional career in the legal domain.
